# Cycle-Management

This project is an attempt to solve the cycle management problem inside the NITT campus. 
Every student who buys a cycle has to register in this cycle management system. 
On registration, he/she gets an QR sticker (which he/she must stick on the body of cycle). 
Now, whenever any cycle which is not kept in proper place is found, the corresponding student will be identified by scanning the QR code on the cycle, and he/she will be fined appropriately. 
At the end of every year members of Recycle group identify all the cycles (whose registration has been expired) in the campus and are dumped in random places, and send them to recycle (repair and resell to new students) making the campus look cleaner and in order.

I have used HTML, CSS for front-end and have connected MySQL (XAMPP server) using PHP. Please find the files in the repo.

The current database is MySQL. I am working towards changing it to MongoDB.

This was a classroom project I did under Dr. Janet Barbanas, Prof. at NIT Trichy.
